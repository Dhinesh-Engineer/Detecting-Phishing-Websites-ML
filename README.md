Detecting phishing websites (Machine Learning)


Phishing is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker creates a fake website or email that looks like it comes from a legitimate source, such as a bank or social media site, in an attempt to steal sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal information. The goal of a phishing attack is to trick the victim into providing this information, which can then be used for fraudulent purposes.

Detecting phishing websites is important to prevent users from falling prey to these attacks. There are several techniques for detecting phishing websites, including:

**URL analysis**: Phishing websites often use URLs that are similar to legitimate websites but with small variations, such as using a misspelled domain name or adding extra characters to the URL. By analyzing the URL of a website, it is possible to identify these types of variations and determine if the website is likely to be a phishing site.

**Content analysis**: Phishing websites often use content that is designed to mimic legitimate websites, such as using the same logos or layout. However, there may be subtle differences in the content that can be used to identify a phishing site, such as poor grammar or misspelled words.

**SSL/TLS analysis**: Phishing websites often do not have a valid SSL/TLS certificate, which is used to encrypt the connection between the website and the user's browser. By analyzing the SSL/TLS certificate of a website, it is possible to determine if the website is legitimate or a phishing site.

**Machine learning**: Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze various features of a website, such as the URL structure, content, and SSL/TLS certificate, to determine if a website is likely to be a phishing site. Machine learning models can be trained on large datasets of known phishing sites to improve their accuracy.

Overall, detecting phishing websites requires a combination of technical analysis and user education to help users identify and avoid these types of attacks.
